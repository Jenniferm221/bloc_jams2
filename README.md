# Bloc Jams React Project

Bloc Jams is a my first React Single page application (SPA) that was built as part of my curriculum through Bloc. If you do not know, a SPA is a way to easily make web applications and web pages that have faster load times when visited. Bloc Jams is meant to mimic a Spotify like music applications. This was my first time working to build a SPA completely with React. It was a learning experience in managing state and props, while building a responsive webpage.

## Built With

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - JS library to build frontend
* [React Router](https://github.com/ui-router/react) - Built state based route for SPA
* [Semantic UI - React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) - Built styling for responsive mobile site\
